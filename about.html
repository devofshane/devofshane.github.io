				<h3>Personal Statement</h3>
				<p>Back in 2001 my family got its first computer, thanks to my late grandmother. It was an old Dell PC,
				even at the time, with an extremely large and unweidly CRT monitor that had a dimmed bulb for most of its
				time with us. Nonetheless, I was enthralled by what could be done by this monstrous device. I played my
				first game ever on it, <i>Gold and Glory: The Road to El Dorado</i>, and sunk hours and hours into the game -
				all the while, curious as to how it was even doing everything it did. It wasn't until later, after a few years
				into a game called <i>Runescape</i>, that I decided to actually research the topic for myself. I found out that
				<i>Runescape</i> was written in a programming language called Java, I had to look up what a programming language
				even was at the time. Later down the road, when I was about 15, I gave my first crack at programming and I had
				absolutely no idea what I was doing, but I was already in love. From that time, and before starting college, I
				gave many attempts at programming, learning precious little in the process but falling more and more in love
				with every failure.</p>
				<p>After starting college I finally got serious about learning to program, and even more so learning about
				computer science as a whole. I've learned that there is so much more behind software development than simply 
				writing some lines of code until something finally works. There is a vast amount of approaches to creating any 
				piece of software, no matter how complex. You go through  the process of planning, analyzing, designing, and
				then finally implementing a project, and that is just the first iteration. I've already learned the importance
				of creating clean, readable, and reusable code and applying the best design patterns to meet the needs of the
				project. Finally, I learned the importance that algorithms hold in the creation of any software that needs
				to be even somewhat efficient</p>
				<p>Everytime I learn something new I realize that there is still so much more left to learn. I try to learn
				a new technology or programming language roughly every three months. I certainly don't master these in such
				a short amount of time, but I learn enough to be able to use them somewhat efficiently. In 2016 I've worked
				to fill in my gaps of knowledge about Java, and learn important tools of the trade that Java utilizes. In
				2017 I plan to tackle C# and the .NET platform that is being made increasingly more open sourced by Microsoft.
				Learning is a journey I enjoy almost more than anything else, so I plan to continue for as long as I can.</p>
