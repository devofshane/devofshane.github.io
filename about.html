				<h3>About</h3>
				<p>Hello there, my name is Shane! I am current an aspiring software developer, who is finishing up schooling (both formal and informal). I am interested in building pretty much anything that sets out to solve a problem. Being able to solve a problem for myself or others provides a mental high that is hard to describe, and leaves me with a feeling of accomplishment. I currently don't have any languages that I want to focus on because I am willing to use whatever gets the job done, but a vast majority of my learning has been Java based - so that is the language I am most familiar with.</p>
				<p>I also have a particular love of programming because there is always something new to learn, and I love to learn - even though I am not the best at it. Learning new things provides me with new ways of thinking that I may not have encountered otherwise. I don't have learn about software development in my freetime though, (well, most of the times I am focusing on learning software development these days) - I also like to delve into history and how everyday things were invented and created. Reading is also a big hobby of mine, mostly non-fiction.</p>
				<p>Please feel free to follow me on Twitter, my username is <a href="http://twitter.com/techyshane">@techyshane</a>.</p>
